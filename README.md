#CamSplash

An arduino project meant to help me trigger a photo on my dslr at the correct time.

This is mostly meant for splash or other tight timed zoomed in photography.

Built with platformio.

TODO:

	* Add schematics
	* Configureable delay
	* UI?
	* Timelapse
	* Lightning mode
	* Audio triggered
